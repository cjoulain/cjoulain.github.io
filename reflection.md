**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?  What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I didn't have difficulty with borders but I did have difficulty with the navigation bar.  While I was able to get a menu set up, the background color took up only 60% of the screen.  I tried different types of position (relative, fixed) but I couldn't figure it out how to extend the nav bar across the entire screen.  I was able to set up rounded borders and padding wasn't too bad.  However, when I tried to add a left column to my site, I did have problems with margins.  The header wouldn't align properly with the left column, so I wound up eliminating something I do want to be part of the site.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Setting the proper background color was easy enough.  I don't think I had difficulty with the header and fooder.  However, having a fully functional nav bar and left column was a challenge.  I think I need a container to make those elements come together.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

By experimenting with elements (choosing to implement top or left, for instance), you can radically change the look of the site.  While things like height and width seem easy enough, I couldn't always get them to work for the vision I had in mind.  I think I need to re-think the framework.  I also had this tendency to overload my CSS with functions.  I think I might need to sit down with ChromeDev and figure things out.
