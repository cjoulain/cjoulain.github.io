<!-- It was great working with a pair, as there were a few things I was unsure of (such as adding sections and footer vs. page break) and it was helpful to get feedback on how to structure the web page.

I found wireframing to be very beneficial.  It's important to start in small, manageable steps.  It's also helpful to start off with a visual sketch and see what actions you need to make to make the outline a reality.

In terms of what makes a good wireframe, many HTML pages seem to have a similar basic structure.  Some pages are more complex than others (offering an array of menu buttons, for instance).  I'm looking forward to learning more HTML and CSS, so I can make my site user-friendly.

In terms of semantic elements, we learned about splitting the web page into sections.  By using <section>, for instance, this might not alter the look of the page but more clearly defines the page's content.  I previously used a different tag to create the footer in a prior assignment (which might have been a line break), so it was good to learn which elements are a good fit for the page.
