<p>Greetings,

Here are a few comments on what I’ve learned with CSS positioning.</p>

<p>IDs and classes are generally nested within the div tag, which helps us orient us to the shape and design of a web site.  IDs can only be used once.  With classes, you can use the same class over multiple elements, making it more versatile and easier to make changes to.</p>

<p>A few key terms to consider when designing a site are fixed, static, relative, and absolute positioning.  With fixed positioning, as the name suggests, the info or display will stay put (handy for elements like nav bars). Static is the default position of the display.  Relative means the element is relative to itself; it’s said it’s easier to maintain a page’s flow with relative. With absolute, the elements of top, left, bottom, and right are key to positioning the display where you want it.</p>

<p>In CSS, the margin refers to the space surrounding a box.  The padding is the space between the border and the content.  The border includes the edges of a box or display.  With borders, you can create a striking edge (dashed is an option, for instance) and style them in different colors.</p>

<p>Both inline and inline block are supposed to flow within a text.  Inline allows you to adjust to the left and right of whatever is being displayed. With inline block, you are able to set a width and height and display them almost as in a row.</p>
