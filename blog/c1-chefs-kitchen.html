  <h1>Thoughts on DBC So Far...</h1>

      Hi DBC-ers.  It’s been a busy week.  It made me realize how much I have to learn about software engineering and to be a bit gentle on myself.  Things started off with a bunch of computer issues that I tried to troubleshoot but couldn’t successfully (it was a hardware issue and seems to have been resolved).  That definitely taught me that there are always unexpected situations that happen and that you have to roll with it rather than get frustrated.  I liked Shereef’s critique of the consumer mindset.  Nothing automatically happens, especially the learning process.  For me (and this came through in some of this week’s readings), consistency is key.  Not everything will make sense at first, even if you followed instructions.  Rinse and repeat.  And then concepts start to stick.  So far I’ve sensed that DBC is a very supportive environment.  Most of us are novices who can feel intimidated by what we don’t know.  With time and repetition, it’ll get easier.  (There were definitely be tough times, though!)  A week ago, I didn’t know the command line and now I feel comfortable doing basic functions.  I’m looking forward to familiarizing myself with Git, as there are a few concepts that I think I understand but want to know deeper.  I also appreciated Shereef talking about people as agents who are able to shape their own environment.

      I’m looking forward to pair programming.  Right now, the biggest question for me — especially since we’re remote right now — is how do you get the help you need?  I think some of it is going over things several times.  If it doesn’t stick, it’s definitely reaching out to your cohort, the office hour teaching assistants, and the DBC staff.   I wanted to comment on the blogs of others but am having some access issues.

      Well, that’s all for now.  See you on the Git side…
