<h3> Ruby Classes </h3>
  <p> Hi there!  Today, we’ll be discussing classes.  Others have described them as a blueprint for objects and over the passed few weeks, we’ve done some experimenting with them.  Essentially, classes can tell us what an object is and how it can be implemented.In prior weeks, objects were defined us but now we’re having a go at creating objects ourselves.  Classes can structure code in such a way that it make it code easier to categorize (and as a result, easier to read).</p>
  <p> Instance variables are central to understanding classes.  Like a local variable, they are assigned a value and can read that value back to you.  However, they are available across different methods that are within the same class.  They are followed by the at sign (@).  They are optional for storing and retrieving across state.</p>
  <p> Here’s an example of classes in action: </p>
<code> class Hockey
  def initialize(team,league)<br>
    @team = team<br>
    @league = league<br>
end<br>
<br>
    def statement <br>
      puts "I follow the #{@team} of the #{@league}!"<br>
    end<br>
  end<br>
<br>
  hockey = Hockey.new("NJ Devils", "NHL")<br>
  hockey.statement<br>
</code>
<p> After defining your class (Hockey), initialize is the next step in the creation process.  After that, you can go about creating/defining methods utilizing your instance variables (@team and @league).  At the end, we needed to call it in order for it to go into effect.</p>

<p>This produces as output: </p>
<code> I follow the NJ Devils of the NHL</code>
<p> One way to call upon the object is “Object.new.”  It creates a new object and you assign it (and hold it) to a variable.  In this case, we called it hockey.  I was also able to print the statement using the instance variables.</p>
<p> What are the advantages of classes?  If you have an object, you can pass it around different methods, hashes, and arrays.  It also allows for the use of simple labels.  A small thing I’ve noticed is that we’re encouraged to name classes using everyday phrases.  It’s handy to understand its function when its spelled out in plain English.  For the purposes of time, I’ve named variables all sorts of abbreviations and, going back, it took a while to figure out what I meant.  So you can imagine a stranger reading your code and not always getting your meaning. </p>
<p> I used a simple example above.  Classes are very complex but I look forward to learning more and then reporting back.</p>
<p> More later,
CJ</p>
