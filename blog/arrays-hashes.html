  <h3>Hashes and Arrays: A Beginner's Guide</h3>
<p>This week, I learned about the difference between hashes and arrays.  This was a big step in my learning development, as other than Code Academy, I’m completely new to Ruby and to programming in general.  I had helpful pairs, which was a boost.  And I scoured the Internet for many hours looking for resources on Ruby. </p>
<p>So the topic at hand: arrays vs. hashes.  In a nutshell, arrays are ordered collection of objects.  Remember that Ruby is an object-oriented language and that objects are a core facet of its structure.  Arrays take objects, put them together in order and keep their position in same order.  The objects will then be indexed according to what position they hold.  Arrays hold many things, including strings, numbers and even other arrays.  Arrays use square brackets.  Arrays will stay order, though you have the flexibility to pull items out of array and then re-arrange them.</p>

<p>There a few commands that can come in handy.  For instance, by using .clear, you can create an empty array.</p>
<code>array_example = [1, 2, 3]<br>
array_example.clear</code>
<p>Join will splice together an array.  I used this in a few of our exercises this week.</p>
<code>puts array_example.join<br>
123</code>
<p>Or convert them into a string:</p>
<code>array_example._to_s<br>
"[1, 2, 3, 4]"</code>
<p>Hashes, in contrast, are unordered collections of objects.  They work in pair form; they have a key and a value.  They are not structured by position the way arrays are.  They’re structured by object.  When order matters, use array.  When order doesn’t matter but label does, hash is preferable.  For instance, if I wanted to find out different things about Homer Simpson, I’d use a hash.  The hash below reveals Homer’s characteristics, which I can access.<p>

<code> person = { :first_name => ‘Homer’, :last_name => ‘Simpson’ }<br>
enters person[:catch phrase] = ‘doh’</code>
