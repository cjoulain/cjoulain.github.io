<h3> Loops in JS </h3>
  <p> So iteration is a basic concept in programming.  It’s a best practice to write code that is clear and to the point.  Looping is one way to write something once but to an action repeated over again in an efficient way.  As JavaScript is frequently used in conjunction with HTML and CSS, there are going to functions or commands we want repeated.  For instance, if you wanted to process links in a web page in a certain way, you’d want to use a loop.</p>

  <p> While loops are great, they can repeat infinitely.  It’s important to use conditional statements in conjunction with them (for example, “if” or “while” statements).</p>

  <p>One basic loop involves “while.”  Here’s a simple example of that:</p>

<code> var x = 2; <br>
while (x <10 ) { <br>
  console.log(x); <br>
  x++; <br>
} <br>
</code>

<p> Whatever is in the code block will be executed.  If we read it line by line.  First you create a variable and set it equal to a number.  I believe this is called creating the index.  In the while statement, we see that the statement x < 10 is true, so it will execute the command.  To assure that the loop is not infinite, you increment the value of x (or x++ in the example).  Because x will be incremented, once we reach 10, the code will note the statement x < 10 as false and then stop the loop.  The console log command will then print out the list of numbers (a range of 2 to 9).</p>

<p> While the process is similar in Ruby, some of the key terms differ.  “For” and “while” in Javascript are key commands that initiate the loop.  In Ruby, you could choose to use “do”, as well as “each” to iterate over something like an array.  If/elsif/else would be likely be the commands you use to break out of a loop.  Curly braces tend to execute a JavaScript loop, while piping is common for Ruby.</p>

<p> There's more to say but I'm currently on several deadlines!</p>
<p> I'm going to spruce things up here very soon, probably mid-week.  Check back then.  Thanks for reading.
<p> More later,
CJ</p>
