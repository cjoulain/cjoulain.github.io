<h3> A Note on Web Basics </h3>
  <p> Howdy all!  This week, we’ve been instructed to write on a tech-oriented topic of our choosing.  I recently read <a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US/home">20 Things I Learned About Browsers and the Web</a> and wanted to share a few salient points from that nifty e-book.</p>

  <p>While many of us think of the Internet as a wireless cloud, it’s also important to note that underground cables (which connect servers to one another) very much enable the Internet into existence.  Chapter 1 of the e-book begins by noting the invention of TCP/IP in 1974.  This invention allowed for computers to send information back and forth to each other.</p>

  <p>The information we send to one another over the Internet can actually be broken down into data chunks called packets.  The writer(s) of <u>20 Things</u> use reading email as an example of accessing packets.  I know when I connect into Gmail, my primary email client, I’ll click on an individual email that piques my interest.  Let’s say I see “Hilarious Cat Picture” as the subject of one email.  I click on that and see the aforementioned hilarious kitty.  While we see everything “as a whole,” the data has actually been constructed in segmented chunks.  Our browser serves the purpose of re-assembling those data chunks in a unified manner.  Bandwidth refers to the speed in which we can access Internet data per second.  The capabilities are so advanced nowadays that, with the right equipment (such as fiberoptic cables), we can access data as fast as the speed of light.</p>

  <p>Right now, we’re in the early stages of learning JavaScript.  JS, in tandem with HTML and CSS, can make websites interactive.  I learned recently that it was JavaScript that allowed for a email server like Gmail to flourish.  Before then, we’d have to refresh our browser for new emails and updates.  However, thanks to JS (in particular, XHR), new updates appeared without our having to refresh.  Many web apps are able to thrive thanks to these instantaneous updates.</p>

  <p>And speaking of browsers, “cookies” is another subject worth knowing.  A cookie is an archive of text that is stored in one’s browser after visiting a website.  This archive includes notable features of the site, including various preferred settings.  The next time we visit a site, the browser pulls up the data it recalls from the prior visit.  The purpose of this is to make our browsing experience more personalized.  While cookies can be very handy (for instance, storing passwords for repeated use), those concerned with privacy would argue that there’s a downside to cookies.  For instance, companies can collect this data to try to sell you things based on your search history.  This is why, using Gmail as an example again, you’ll notice your ads change based on the subjects of your emails.  So if I tend to send emails involving hilarious cats (which, full disclosure, I do), I shouldn’t be surprised by ads related to kitty consumption (food, toys, etc.).  However, there are ways to circumvent unsolicited “cookie use.”  You can block cookies from some sites (especially third party cookies, which are often embedded in ad banners) and allow them for your preferred sites.</p>

  <p>I know most of you are probably familiar with these concepts but I actually hadn’t thought about some of the topics mentioned above in much detail.  One thing I’m guilty of is not always installing the latest browser updates but I’m realizing frequent updates can protect us against various security breaches and, in general, will facilitate in a smoother running of the Internet.  I’ve often been intimidated by technology and want to understand it better, because it has the capacity to improve the current way we do things.  So I'm excited about the journey ahead.  Hopefully bit by bit (byte by byte?), I’ll get there, with the help of my DBC and tech friends.  Thanks for reading this and feel free to share your thoughts/questions.</p>

  <p> All for now,<br>
