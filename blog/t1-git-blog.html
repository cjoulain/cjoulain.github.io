      Hello world!
    </p>
    <p>
        It's been an eventful week so far.  The exercises this week were the most advanced computer hacking that I've done.  I'm excited to learn more.

        I'm starting to understand what DBC meant by the importance of reptition.  When I first started pushing my local files to GitHub, I was intimidated.  Even if you follow instructions to a T, there's always the chance you won't do the proper process.  Where you are in a directory or path (or master file or branch) does matter.  After doing push/pull a few times, I'm much less scared of overwriting or losting my data.  With practice comes confidence.  There are a few concepts that I'm hazy on but now I'm going to go back, retrace myself, and see if I can understand the logic at play.

        Thanks for reading.  Happy hacking...
