      Hello world!
    </p>
    <p>
        It's been an eventful week so far.  The exercises this week were the most advanced computer hacking that I've done.  I'm excited to learn more.

        Git provides a history of tracking edits/changes, also known as version control.  Without it, a team of users could overwrite the changes of the other(s).  In the event something modified proved to be crucial, you can allows refer back to a prior edit.  Version control software like Git allows developers to keep track of who changed something and why they changed it.  Some have called it “social coding,” as it allows a team to work interactively with one another and with their shared code.  A process called merging allows team members to work on the same file.  That also assures everyone is working on the most up-to-date product and not relying on an older version.  One writer used a tree analogy, where you can work on “branches” while the “root” of crucial information remains constant.  A commit is a form of saving the code where the changes enacted are described; it’s like an archive with an explanation.

      </p> While Git is a version-control software (run from the terminal of your computer), GitHub is a website where you upload data.  Via commands like “git push,” you can save your git data onto the GitHub website but it won’t happen unless you issue commands to expressly do that.  Because GitHub is remote, it allows for a user or team to access data as long as they have an Internet connection (a time and memory saver).  An Internet repository would seem to allow for more interactivity from a team or even, if one makes data public, to the larger world.  GitHub would be excellent for many open-source projects, where you could view someone else’s data and suggest changes or fix bugs.

        Thanks for reading.  Happy hacking...
