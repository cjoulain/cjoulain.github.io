  <p> Hello world!<p>
<p>My name's CJ and I recently created this blog.  I've spent a few years in the nonprofit media world and am looking forward to transitioning into a career in web development.</p>

<p> I'm originally from New Jersey (yes, I know -- the jokes write themselves) but spent some time in Southern California.  I now call the Bay Area home.  In addition to reading and learning all about web development, I also enjoy following sports, especially hockey, and am an avid film buff.</p>

<p>One quirky thing about me is that I was a breakdancer as a kid.  Please don't ask for a demo though, as I hung up the Adidas long ago... :-)<p>

<p>Check out this blog for future updates!</p>
More soon,
CJ</p>
